	abstract = {Given a stream of heterogeneous graphs containing different types of nodes and edges, how can we spot anomalous ones in real-time while consuming bounded memory? This problem is motivated by and generalizes from its application in security to host-level advanced persistent threat (APT) detection. We propose StreamSpot, a clustering based anomaly detection approach that addresses challenges in two key fronts: (1) heterogeneity, and (2) streaming nature. We introduce a new similarity function for heterogeneous graphs that compares two graphs based on their relative frequency of local substructures, represented as short strings. This function lends itself to a vector representation of a graph, which is (a) fast to compute, and (b) amenable to a sketched version with bounded size that preserves similarity. StreamSpot exhibits desirable properties that a streaming application requires: it is (i) fully-streaming; processing the stream one edge at a time as it arrives, (ii) memory-efficient; requiring constant space for the sketches and the clustering, (iii) fast; taking constant time to update the graph sketches and the cluster summaries that can process over 100,000 edges per second, and (iv) online; scoring and flagging anomalies in real time. Experiments on datasets containing simulated system-call flow graphs from normal browser activity and various attack scenarios (ground truth) show that StreamSpot is high-performance; achieving above 95\% detection accuracy with small delay, as well as competitive time and memory usage.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the `why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open theoretical and practical challenges in the field.},

Based on these system calls we can predict the normal or abnormal behavior of applications. This can be done by classification. In this paper we tried to perform classification of processes running into normal and abnormal states by using system call behavior. We reduce the system call feature vector by choosing k-means algorithm which uses the proposed measure for dimensionality reduction. We give the design of the proposed measure.

	abstract = {End-to-end tracing has emerged recently as a valuable tool to improve the dependability of distributed systems by performing dynamic verification and diagnosing cor-rectness and performance problems. End-to-end traces are commonly represented as richly annotated directed acyclic graphs, with events as nodes and their causal dependencies as edges. Being able to automatically compare these graphs at scale is a key primitive for tasks such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. In this paper we explore recent developments in the theory of graph kernels, and investigate the feasibility of using a family of kernels based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test [35] as an efficient and robust graph comparison primitive. We find that graph kernels provide a good formulation of the execution graph comparison problem, and present preliminary but encouraging results on their ability to distinguish high-level differences between execution graphs.},

The goal of monitoring program behavior is to be able to detect potential intrusions by noting irregularities in program behavior. The techniques start from a simple equality matching algorithm for determining anomalous behavior, and evolve to a feed-forward backpropagation neural network for learning program behavior, and finally to an Elman network for recognizing recurrent features in program execution traces. In order to detect future attacks against systems, intrusion detection systems must be able to generalize from past observed behavior. The goal of this research is to employ machine learning techniques that can generalize from past observed behavior to the problem of intrusion detection. The performance of these systems is compared by testing them with data provided by the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation program.},

In many such applications, it is useful to detect structural abnormalities which are different from the “typical” behavior of the underlying network. In this paper, we will provide first results on the problem of structural outlier detection in massive network streams. Such problems are inherently challenging, because the problem of outlier detection is specially challenging because of the high volume of the underlying network stream. The stream scenario also increases the computational challenges for the approach. We use a structural connectivity model in order to define outliers in graph streams. In order to handle the sparsity problem of massive networks, we dynamically partition the network in order to construct statistically robust models of the connectivity behavior. We design a reservoir sampling method in order to maintain structural summaries of the underlying network. These structural summaries are designed in order to create robust, dynamic and efficient models for outlier detection in graph streams. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},
